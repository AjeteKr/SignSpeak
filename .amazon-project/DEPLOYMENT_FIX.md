# 🚀 SignSpeak Streamlit Deployment - Fixed Requirements

## ✅ Problem Solved
The deployment error was caused by incompatible dependencies. I've fixed your `requirements.txt` with Streamlit Cloud-compatible packages.

## 📋 Key Changes Made:

### ❌ **Removed (Causing Errors):**
- `pywin32`, `pypiwin32` (Windows-only)
- `torch`, `torchvision` (too large for free tier)
- `opencv-contrib-python` (replaced with headless version)
- Heavy TensorFlow packages (switched to CPU version)

### ✅ **Optimized:**
- `opencv-python-headless` (cloud-compatible)
- `tensorflow-cpu` (lighter, cloud-friendly)
- Version constraints to prevent conflicts
- Cross-platform packages only

## 🚀 Deploy Again:

1. **Commit & Push** your updated `requirements.txt`
2. **Go back to Streamlit Cloud** and redeploy
3. **Or create new app** with these settings:

```
Repository: AjeteKr/SignSpeak
Branch: main
Main file path: .amazon-project/signspeak_pro.py
```

## 🔍 **If Still Failing:**

Check the **terminal logs** in "Manage App" for specific error messages and let me know what you see.

Your ASL recognition app should now deploy successfully! 🎉

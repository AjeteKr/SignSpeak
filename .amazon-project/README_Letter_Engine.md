# ASL Letter Accumulation Engine

This enhanced ASL recognition system now includes advanced letter accumulation, smart spacing, and word completion features.

## New Features

### 1. Letter Accumulation Engine
- **Letter Confirmation**: Letters are confirmed after consistent detection (1 second of stable recognition)
- **Visual Progress**: Shows confirmation progress on video feed
- **Robust Detection**: Reduces false positives by requiring sustained detection

### 2. Smart Spacing Logic
- **Pause Detection**: Automatically adds spaces when no hand is visible for 1.5+ seconds
- **Gesture-based Spacing**: Flat hand gesture (all fingers extended) with horizontal movement adds spaces
- **Time-based Spacing**: Letters held for 2+ seconds are confirmed and space is added

### 3. Word Completion Features
- **Dictionary Integration**: 200+ common English words for suggestions
- **Auto-complete**: Shows word suggestions when 2+ letters are typed
- **Manual Confirmation**: Click suggestions to complete words
- **ASL-specific words**: Includes deaf/hearing community terms

### 4. Enhanced UI
- **Current Text Display**: Shows building word and complete sentence
- **Word Suggestions**: Interactive buttons for quick word completion
- **Manual Controls**: Add space, finish word, clear all buttons
- **Multiple TTS Options**: Read current word, sentence, or all text

## How to Use

1. **Start Video**: Click "Start Video" to begin ASL recognition
2. **Sign Letters**: Hold each letter sign for ~1 second to confirm
3. **Add Spaces**: 
   - Wait 1.5 seconds with no hand visible
   - Use flat hand gesture with horizontal movement
   - Or click "Add Space" button
4. **Complete Words**: Click word suggestions or "Finish Word" button
5. **Text-to-Speech**: Use the "Read" buttons to hear your text

## Letter Mapping

The system recognizes these ASL letters and signs:
- **Letters**: A, B, C, D, E, I, K, L, M, O, V, Y

```

## Configuration

### Timing Settings
- **Letter Confirmation**: 30 frames (~1 second at 30 FPS)
- **Letter Hold Time**: 2 seconds for auto-spacing
- **Pause Detection**: 45 frames (~1.5 seconds)

### Word Dictionary
- Located in `word_dictionary.py`
- Contains 200+ common words
- Easy to extend with more words

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Consistent Signing**: Hold each letter clearly for at least 1 second
2. **Good Lighting**: Ensure adequate lighting for hand detection
3. **Clear Background**: Use a contrasting background for better detection
4. **Steady Hand**: Keep hand position stable during letter confirmation
5. **Practice Mode**: Use practice mode to perfect individual letters

## Troubleshooting

- **Letters not confirming**: Hold the sign longer and more steadily
- **Wrong letters detected**: Check hand position against reference images
- **No word suggestions**: Type at least 2 letters to see suggestions
- **Camera issues**: Check webcam permissions and connection

## Technical Details

# Demo and Testing Guide for ASL Letter Accumulation System

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install streamlit opencv-python mediapipe numpy pyttsx3
```

### 2. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### 3. Test the System

#### Basic Letter Testing:
1. Start the video
2. Make these simple signs and hold for 3 seconds each:
   - **Fist (A)** - Close all fingers into fist
   - **OK sign (O)** - Touch thumb and index finger
   - **Point up (D)** - Only index finger extended
   - **Peace/V sign (V)** - Index and middle finger up

#### Word Building Test:
1. Sign: A-D-D → should suggest "ADD"
2. Sign: C-A-R → should suggest "CAR" 
3. Sign: Y-E-S → should suggest "YES"

#### Spacing Test:
1. Sign a letter (A)
2. Remove hand completely for 2+ seconds
3. Sign another letter (B)
4. Should see: "A B" with space between

### 4. Troubleshooting

**If letters aren't being detected:**
- Ensure good lighting
- Hold hand closer to camera (but keep full hand visible)
- Hold the sign very steady for full 3 seconds
- Check that your sign matches ASL references

**If wrong letters are detected:**
- Practice the exact hand positions for ASL letters
- Make sure fingers are clearly extended or closed as needed
- Avoid intermediate positions between letters

**If camera shows error:**
- Check webcam permissions
- Close other applications using the camera
- Try restarting the Streamlit app

### 5. Expected Behavior

- **3-second confirmation** prevents accidental letters
- **Auto-spacing** after 2 seconds with no hand
- **Word suggestions** appear after 2+ letters
- **Voice feedback** when letters are confirmed
- **Progress bar** shows confirmation status

### 6. Demo Sequence

Try this sequence to demonstrate the system:
1. Sign "H-E-L-L-O" (use available letters like A-D-D instead)
2. Remove hand for spacing
3. Sign "W-O-R-L-D" (use V-O instead)
4. Click word suggestions to complete
5. Use "Read All Text" to hear the result

This creates a full demonstration of letter recognition, word building, spacing, and text-to-speech functionality.
